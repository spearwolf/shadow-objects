# umbra-ents

> _umbra ents_ is short for latin _"umbra entitatis"_, which translates to _"shadow entities"_

Each _entity_ belongs to a _view component_, but exists in a _web worker_ (therefore called _shadow_, because they are located outside the document, analogous to the elements in a _html shadow DOM_), where the _components_ are located in the main document of the browser.
