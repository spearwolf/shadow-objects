# shadow-objects ðŸ§›

## Introduction

_Shadow-objects_ is a standalone, reactive entity&larr;component framework ðŸ”¥

The original idea is visualized in this overview:

![architecture overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spearwolf/shadow-objects/main/packages/shadow-objects/docs/architecture%402x.png)

> _ents_ is short for latin _"entitatis"_, which translates to _"shadow entities"_

The components are created in the view space. Hierarchical. In your browser. There is a JavaScript API for this. But to keep things simple, there are also ready-to-use web components.

```html
<shae-worker-env local? src="./my-personal-shadow-objects.js" />

<shae-ent ns? token="foo">
  <shae-ent ns? token="bar">
    <shae-prop name="myNumbers" value="1 2 3" type="integer[]" />
  </shae-ent>
</shae-ent>
```

In the shadows, the _shadow objects_ come and go with the entities. An entity can cover many shadows. But all are united by the entity _token_. That token, which is specified by the _view components_.

The _shadow object module_ stores which shadow objects are hidden behind a token. Either a _function_ or a _class_.

```js
shadowObjects.define('token', function() {
  console.log('The simplest shadow object ever.');
});

@ShadowObject('token')
class Foo {
  constructor({
    entity,
    provideContext,
    useContext,
    useProperty,
    onDestroy,
  }: ShadowObjectParams) {
    console.log('hello');    
    
    onDestroy(() => {
      console.log('bye');
    });
  }
}
```

TODO ... add documentation here ... !
