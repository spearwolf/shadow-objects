# visual-fx-web-components

this is a monorepo based on [nx](https://nx.dev/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

Just use ...

```sh
$ pnpm install
```

... to install or refresh all the dependencies. After that you can simply build and test all packages with ..

```sh
$ pnpm cbt
```

Thank you and have a nice day ;-)
